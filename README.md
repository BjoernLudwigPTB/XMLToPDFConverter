Convert XML template to PDF table. Since the forking this project has generalized
quite a bit on the generation of a multipage PDF file containing a table with defined
columns. Since we work on this project every end of the year, we will provide an
extensive bit of documentation by the end of November 2019.

## Getting started 
As a starting point you could take a look at the execution of `MainPredefiend.py`
which will download a publicly available XML-file into the folder *input* and process
it as desired to produce the output files (one file containing all generated pages
 and additionally one file per page) and place them in the subfolder *output*.
